<h3> URL Shortener App </h3>

## Description

This application is a greater URL shortener. In few steps, we can build many short URL's to redirect for original URL's. Each short location is identified and unique in our database. We can also list all URL's originated by you (your user), access count of acess number's for each location, and manage the user's database.

## Project setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/thauan01/project-url-shortener.git
$ cd project-url-shortener/url_shortener
```

### 2. Start the database with Docker Compose

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
$ npm run start
```
